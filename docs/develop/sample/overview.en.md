This case teaches you how to develop your own modules from scratch, step by step, by implementing a TodoList list in OpenSumi, and through this case you will gain some knowledge as follows:

- How to create a module
- How to present a list
- How to use and register services through DI
- How to use the contribution point mechanism
- How to implement frontend and backend communication

We aim toï¼š

- Register a TodoList panel in the left explorer panel
- Display TodoList list
- Support for quick addition of Todo items via shortcut keys
- Implement basic two-way communication logic between front and back end

Through this case study, you will be able to quickly get started with OpenSumi's module development. 

At the same time, if you want to see the code directly, you can directly access the repo [opensumi/todo-list-sample](https://github.com/opensumi/todo-list-sample) directly, and run projects to get some understandings directly.
